# AES Text Encryption

AES is a multi-language console application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using a password. The application uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for secure encryption, providing a straightforward interface across various programming languages.

## Features

- **Text Encryption**: Users can input any text and encrypt it using a custom password.
- **Text Decryption**: Encrypted text can be decrypted with the same password used during encryption.
- **Simple Interface**: The application provides an easy-to-use interface for performing encryption and decryption in multiple programming languages.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10 or higher
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 or higher for VB.NET version
- Ruby, Java, Python, or C++ compilers/interpreters for their respective versions

## Setup and Run

1. **Open the Solution**:
   - Navigate to the `AES` directory.
   - Open the solution in the respective IDE or text editor for the language you are using.

2. **Build the Application** (if applicable):
   - For VB.NET, build the solution in Visual Studio to generate the executable file.
   - For other languages, follow the specific build/run instructions for that language.

3. **Run the Application**:
   - Launch the application using the command line or terminal for the chosen programming language.

## How It Works

1. **Encrypt Text**:
   - Enter the text you want to encrypt in the provided input field or console.
   - Set a password to use for encryption.
   - Click the 'Encrypt' button or run the respective command, and the encrypted output will be displayed.

2. **Decrypt Text**:
   - Paste the encrypted text into the decryption field or console.
   - Enter the same password that was used for encryption.
   - Click the 'Decrypt' button or run the respective command, and the decrypted original text will be displayed.

## Technologies Used

- **VB.NET**: The core programming language for the Windows Forms application.
- **Ruby**: For the Ruby console version.
- **Java**: For the Java console version.
- **Python**: For the Python console version.
- **C++**: For the C++ console version.
- **.NET Framework**: Provides the base for running the VB.NET application on Windows.
- **AES Encryption**: Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for secure text encryption.
