# AES Text Encryption

AES is a simple VB.NET Windows Forms application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using a password. The application uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for secure encryption, with a straightforward and easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI).

## Features

- **Text Encryption**: Users can input any text and encrypt it using a custom password.
- **Text Decryption**: Encrypted text can be decrypted with the same password used during encryption.
- **Simple User Interface**: The application provides an easy-to-navigate UI for performing encryption and decryption.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10 or higher
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 or higher
- VB.NET-compatible IDE (Visual Studio)

## Setup and Run

1. **Open the Solution**:
   - Navigate to the `AES` directory.
   - Open the solution in Visual Studio.

2. **Build the Application**:
   - In Visual Studio, build the solution to generate the executable file.

3. **Run the Application**:
   - Once built, launch the executable to open the AES encryption tool.

## How It Works

1. **Encrypt Text**:
   - Enter the text you want to encrypt in the provided input field.
   - Set a password to use for encryption.
   - Click the 'Encrypt' button, and the encrypted output will be displayed.

2. **Decrypt Text**:
   - Paste the encrypted text into the decryption field.
   - Enter the same password that was used for encryption.
   - Click the 'Decrypt' button, and the decrypted original text will be displayed.

## Technologies Used

- **VB.NET**: The core programming language used to develop the application.
- **.NET Framework**: Provides the base for running the application on Windows.
- **Windows Forms**: Used for creating the user interface.
- **AES Encryption**: Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for secure text encryption.
